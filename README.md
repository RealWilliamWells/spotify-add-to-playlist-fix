# spotify-add-to-playlist-fix
Spotify is dumb and won't show me the option for adding songs to my Friend's playlist.

It also does not allow me to select multiple songs from my liked list.

For now this script is just for obtaining Uris to add into a REST call to Spotify's API for adding tracks to a playlist.
